# Session log

Append-only. One entry per session, newest at the bottom. `/handoff` writes it; the SessionStart hook shows the last entry. Keep entries under ~25 lines: they are read at the start of every session.

Entry template:

```
## <date> · <card ID> · <outcome: done | split | blocked | review-fixes>
- Branch / PR: card/<id>-<slug> / #<n>
- Done: what now exists (files, behavior), in 1-4 bullets
- Tests: names added; `make check` result
- Deviations: doc changes made and why, or "none"
- Follow-ups: new cards or open questions, or "none"
- Context: rough share of the session budget used (low / medium / high) and whether the card size was right
```
