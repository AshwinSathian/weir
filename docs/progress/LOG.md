# Session log

Append-only. One entry per session, newest at the bottom. `/handoff` writes it; the SessionStart hook shows the last entry. Keep entries under ~25 lines: they are read at the start of every session.

Entry template:

```
## <date> · <card ID> · <outcome: done | split | blocked | review-fixes>
- Branch / PR: card/<id>-<slug> / #<n>
- Done: what now exists (files, behavior), in 1-4 bullets
- Tests: names added; `make check` result
- Deviations: doc changes made and why, or "none"
- Follow-ups: new cards or open questions, or "none"
- Context: rough share of the session budget used (low / medium / high) and whether the card size was right
```

## 2026-09-27 · planning · done
- Branch / PR: main (direct, setup session)
- Done: design documents 00-10, PLAN-weir.md, CLAUDE.md, task cards in docs/cards/, Makefile, CI, scripts (trace, card, section), `.claude/` hooks, skills and reviewer agent, go.mod and doc.go.
- Tests: none yet; `make vet fmt-check trace` pass on the empty module.
- Deviations: none
- Follow-ups: start P0-01.
- Context: n/a

## 2026-09-27 · P0-01 · done
- Branch / PR: card/P0-01-public-types / #1
- Done: errors.go (sentinels, `RequestError`, `OriginError`, `RetryError`, `StatusCode`, `RetryAfter`); request.go (`Request`, `Response`, `CacheInfo`, `FwdReason`, `StaleReason`).
- Tests: TestStatusCode, TestRetryAfter, TestErrorsIs; `make check` passes, trace 8/151.
- Deviations: 01 §4 and 04 §1.3 disagreed. 01 lists `ErrUpgradeNotSupported` (501, FR-UPG-1) and 04 did not, so 04 §1.3 now has it. 04 §1.3 also now states that context errors are checked before `ErrOrigin`, so an `*OriginError` wrapping `context.Canceled` maps to 499. The reviewer raised this; the spec left the order open.
- Follow-ups: none. CI proves itself on this PR; fix plumbing here if it fails.
- Context: low; size S was right.

## 2026-09-27 · P0-01 · review-fixes
- Branch / PR: card/P0-01-public-types / #1
- Done: adversarial review before merge. `StatusCode` and `RetryAfter` now classify by the outermost recognized error in the chain; `*OriginError` is always 502 and hides any weir error, context error or retry hint inside it.
- Tests: new rows in TestStatusCode and TestRetryAfter for the origin's own cancellation, `http.Client` timeouts, nested-engine errors, joined errors, rounding, overflow, typed nil; `make check` passes.
- Deviations: 04 §1.3 now states the chain rule and the `timeoutOrOrigin(err, ctx, tctx)` contract (flight cancelled by `Close` gives `ErrClosed`, not 499); 04 §6.7 builds `tctx` with `WithTimeoutCause(..., ErrOriginTimeout)`. This reverses the first handoff's "context errors before `ErrOrigin`": a false 499 drops a live client with no response.
- Follow-ups: whether a caller cancellation should count as an origin-health failure in §6.7 (`originHealth: true` on every error) belongs to the breaker card. CI runs one Go version from go.mod; D42's two-version matrix waits for the next Go release.
- Context: low.

## 2026-09-27 · P0-02 · done
- Branch / PR: card/P0-02-store-observer-types / #2
- Done: `store` package types, interface, optional `Scrubber`/`Sizer`, `Entry.Size`; `Observer`, `Event`, 19 `EventKind`s with `String`, nil-safe `emit`; `Purge`, `WarmStats`, `EngineStats`, `BreakerState`, `Mode`.
- Tests: TestEntrySize, TestNoThirdPartyImports, TestEventKindString, TestEmit; `make check` passes.
- Deviations: 04 §9.2 gains an `EvMode` row (FR-MODE-1 requires it; the catalog omitted it). Reason vocabulary is new and waits on Ashwin's approval.
- Follow-ups: none. Review should-fixes (sibling-module prefix escape, GOWORK=off) fixed.
- Context: low; size S was right.
