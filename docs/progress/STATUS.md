## Decided 2026-09-28 (delegated by Ashwin after the #24 adversarial review)

Already built, now confirmed: the weirhttp default transport (compression off, no proxy), the coalesce-default clamp to min(10s, `Timeouts.Origin`), and the storetest `Run(t, newStore, opts...)` API with `Synctest()`. The other nine decisions are cards, and each card changes its spec text together with its code:

- M1-17c, the key boundary: h2c is served normally; `#` is rejected in path and query; the cookie limit counts keyed pairs only.
- M1-17d, storability: `s-maxage` must be valid to permit an `Authorization` response; markers are suppressed after unkeyed input; remote conformance tests move behind an `integration` tag.
- M1-17e, responses: the engine strips hop-by-hop fields; a 304 keeps `Content-Encoding` and `Content-Type`; Pragma is ignored when `Cache-Control` is present.

The cards' Notes give the reasons and the options rejected. All three come before M1-18, because closing M1 makes the repo public.

## Notes for the next session

- `cacheable` (serve.go) validates StaleSWR and NeedsValidation entries with validators via `fetch(..., prior)`; SWR still validates in the foreground (`ponytail:`, M5). Under M5, StaleSWR must be served before the `only-if-cached` and Range checks, which today reject or pass through stale SWR entries.
- A Range request that no entry answers (miss or stale) goes through `pass` via `keys.Classified.AsRangePass()` with Range and If-Range (FR-SRV-5 updated). HEAD with Range goes forward as GET and the body is dropped (FR-FWD-4). M11-01 adds 206 from entries; FR-RNG-4's background fill hooks into that `pass` call.
- With `HonorRevalidation`, `no-cache`/`max-age=0` turn Fresh into NeedsValidation (`forcesValidation`), except under `only-if-cached`.
- `fetch` retries a strong-ETag-mismatch 304 under the same timeout; M4 must keep the retry under the same limiter slot. After a validation whose response is unstorable and response-driven, `setMarker` relies on the read-before-write to skip the marker.
- Unowned events: no card emits `EvRequest`, `EvFetchStart`, `EvFetchEnd`, or `EvStoreError{epoch}`; over-size and 5xx responses emit no `EvNotStored`. M1-16 decided not to fold `EvRequest` in (its "every hit/stale/miss/.../error" scope is bigger than a Size S card and depends on M6/M7 reason values); give it its own card. CONNECT/upgrade rejection stays event-less too: `EvKeyRejected`'s reason vocabulary is `RequestError.Reason` values only, and FR-UPG-1 has adapters intercept these before `Serve`.
- Carried: `New` must reject `Forward.Allow` entries naming keyed or hop-by-hop fields and compile query patterns; decide whether `Close` waits for foreground `Serve` calls; codec header-name case; hard-epoch prune and S3-FIFO walk to measure in M1-18.
- `invalidate` (purge.go) handles FR-INV-1 URI, `Location` and `Content-Location`; FR-INV-2 groups are M9-03. Failed `SetEpoch` writes are ignored with no event.
- Newest-wins lives in `storeResponse` (serve.go), not `fetch`; M2 moving the store into the flight must keep the found-record exemption (`sameRecord`). `TestNewerResponseWins` sends a second GET while the first is gated, so under M2 coalescing it must use a key that cannot join the flight.
- Event streams (FR-STR-1, M1-16): `fetch` checks `Content-Type` against `text/event-stream` or `Storable.StreamTypes` right after headers arrive, before the buffered `io.ReadAll`, and sets `fetchResult.stream`; `cacheable` (serve.go) treats it like `res.over` (skip `storeResponse`, leave `resp.Body` as fetch wired it) but never marks it `over`. M2 coalescing and M5 background refresh must keep a `stream` response out of the flight/refresh path (FR-COA-5: followers re-enter, not share it).
- M1-16 review nits left open (not must-fix): no test exercises the operator-configured `Storable.StreamTypes` branch of `isEventStream` (only the `text/event-stream` literal is covered); `TestConnectRejected`/`TestUpgradeRejected` check no origin call but not that no event fires.
- weirhttp (M1-17): `TransportOrigin.Fetch` sends `//` paths in absolute form, suppresses Go's default `User-Agent`, and relies on `DisableCompression` (04 §10). `Middleware` routes upgrades with `keys.IsUpgrade` (exported from `isUpgrade`).
- M1-17 review nits left open: an origin-form `//x` target through `RequestFrom`'s `RequestURI` branch is untested (needs a raw connection; the test's `//` case goes absolute-form); a nil `TransportOrigin.Target` panics (documented contract).
- weirhttp `HandlerOrigin` (M1-17b): enforces a declared `Content-Length` like net/http's server (short body reads fail with `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`, so fetch.go never stores it), refuses 204/304 bodies, discards HEAD bodies, recovers panics and `runtime.Goexit` as `ErrOrigin`. A handler that ignores its context and never writes outlives `Close` (04 §10). The Caddy `nextOrigin` should reuse this writer rather than copy it.
- Threat-model gap for the Caddy card: an in-process origin sees the creator request's context values (FR-COA-9: Caddy vars, auth identity set by upstream middleware). Those are unkeyed input `TransportOrigin` never exposes; docs/06 has no row for it. Decide before the Caddy adapter lands.
